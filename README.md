**Problem Statement**:

Many students have trouble aligning their schedule with friends and finding the time to hang out. Determining the availability of your friends is even more difficult with larger groups, as you would have to either view all their schedules individually or message everyone in a group chat (which can be a hassle to do).

**Problem Objectives**:

The objective of our web application is to solve scheduling issues among friends, and allow one to easily access a friend’s availability at any given time.

**Functional Requirements**:

- Authentication system that allows users to sign up via email, log in, and log out.
- Connect with friends.
- View availability of friends.
- See a friend’s calendar/schedule for any day in the week.
- Option to enable notifications for matching availability with friends.
- Ability to create events with friends.
